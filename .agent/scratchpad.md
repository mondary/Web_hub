# Scratchpad - About Me Page

## Context
Portfolio site for Mondary Clément. Main page has card-based layout with fan animation.
Design uses Inter font, minimal color palette (#111 text, white bg), social bubbles.
Background image: `assets/images/cm_trans.png` (B&W portrait with transparency).

## Tasks

### Phase 1: Create About Page
- [x] Create `about.html` with unique modern design (French content)
- [x] Design responsive layout with bold typography
- [x] Use existing assets (`cm_trans.png` portrait)
- [x] Keep consistent with site aesthetic (Inter font, minimal style)

### Phase 2: Homepage Integration
- [x] Add "À propos" link/button to index.html socials area

### Phase 3: Validation
- [x] Test responsive behavior (mobile) - CSS media queries for 968px and 600px breakpoints
- [x] Verify no external frameworks used - only Font Awesome icons (same as index)
- [x] Confirm homepage layout intact - only added social bubble for about link

## Design Direction
- Bold hero section with large portrait
- Typography-forward (large headings, French content)
- Smooth scroll, subtle animations
- Sections: intro, parcours/skills, contact link back
- Color palette: white, #111, maybe a subtle accent
